            <h1>Launching the website!</h1>
            <div>by Cow | 3. April 2019</div>
            <br>
            <br>
            <div><a style="font-weight: bold;">FINALLY!</a> After quite the amount of design changes and rewriting the code for the backend, made in PHP‚Ä¶ We can launch the website!</div>
            <br>
            <div>Now.. There are a couple of features missing that will be added later on, the ‚ÄúStatistics section‚Äù and the ‚ÄúForum‚Äù. Now, we do have a <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/hxcJsXu" style="color:#5bc0be;" target="_blank">Discord server</a>, and it will definitely be the main channel of communication for the community going forward. I also wish to streamline the blog, so that can be 100% be done from the website itself, instead of having to manually create the .php file, etc‚Ä¶ </div>
            <br>
            <div>So for now, my main focus is back on Game Dev and not so much on Website and PHP (Thankfullyü§¢) Later on, since the website currently is very static, and not much of PHP is actually implemented, there might be a change to Node.JS as the primary "engine" running the server. Using PHP here, was much more a learning experience, and I can tell why people dont like it...</div>
            <br>
            <div><a style="color: #5bc0be; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Huryiade</a> has done a great job so far, on the leveling system and the stat system, both the front- and backend side of things! Ill probably talk more about it in a later blogpost, so stay tuned!</div> <br>
            <div><a style="color: #5bc0be; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Trebor</a> has also done a fantastic job on the dungeon generation system, and I cant wait to make models, enviorment and different enemies to play around with it! So a big <h2 style="display: inline;">THANK YOU</h2> too both of you! ‚ù§</div> 
            <br>
            <div>If you have read this far; Thank you, however clich√©, you are my inspiration to keep going ‚ù§ <br> As always, feedback on the website and everything, is always appriciated, and the code is avaliable on <a href="https://github.com/Coow/cows-hacknslash" style="color:#5bc0be;" target="_blank">GitHub</a>!</div>
