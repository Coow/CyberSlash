Gameplay:
=
Top-down RPG-ish game. Draws a lot of inspiration from the Diablo Series and Torchlight. 
Combat should be Bullet-Hell type of, to add a high skill-ceiling to the game, aswell as challenge all the time.
This Bullet-Hell element might limited to; Bosses, or high-level enemies.
The game should be quite the grindy one, to add a lot of playtime, while minimizing content creation. 
(Sounds shitty, I know)

## Before joining the project:
Thank you for even considering joining the project. I truly appriciate every single (meaningfull) contribution made to the project. Sadly I can not accept every request there is, because either: 
1) It has already been done
2) It did not meet the ___GUIDELINES___
3) It simply did not fit the game. 
If 1 or 3 is the case, please don't be discouraged. I still appriciate the effort and work you put in and I hope to see another addition from you. 
Point 1 does not apply to rewrites of code or redoings of models or other assets. The original creator of said asset will still be credited. Don't take this as a "Wow, how rude! He replaced my <insert asset here>!". Rather take it as an opportunity to see what you could potentionally improve or something that you could have done in a different way.
