## What should I know before I get started?
A lot of stuff is already said in the [README](README.md). Here is Art Style, Gameplay, a little bit about our guidelines, etc. Guides and other resources can be found on the [WIKI](https://github.com/Coow/cows-hacknslash/wiki). I highly suggest reading through the [How to contribute](https://github.com/Coow/cows-hacknslash/wiki/How-to-contribute!). It's a detailed walkthrough on how to setup and contribute to the project.

## Submitting bugs
Did you find a bug? Lets find out who to blame! Jk, plz dont. Here's a simple list of what to do!
- Ensure that the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/Coow/cows-hacknslash/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, and as much relevant information as possible. (If in Unity Editor, which version, PC Specs, OS Version)

Wait?! Did you also fix the bug?!
- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
