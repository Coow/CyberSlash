Yes, both .dll's are the same files (from the official branch's windows-dynamic_x86_64/). If you check the Discord/editor build helper, you can see it looks for the same DLL for Windows.

I have not yet perfected the build for Mac/Linux, so it seems it requires separate dlls. I'll update this later. Or if someone wants to offer a pull request?
